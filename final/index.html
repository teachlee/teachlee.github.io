      <h3>About Mountain Biking</h3>
      <img src="images/photodownhill.jpg" alt="Uphil on a Mountain Bike">
      <p>Mountain biking is one of the most exciting sports in the world. <br> <br> 
       There are four main disciplines in competitive mountain biking: downhill, four cross, cross-country and trailquest. <br> <br> 
       They all require fitness, bravery and amazing bike control at scary speeds.<br>  <br>   
       But they are also very different in style from each other.</p>

      <h3>Types of Mountain Bikes</h3>
      <img src="images/moutianbike.jpg" alt="Typical Mountain Bike">
      <p>Mountain bikes are bicycles that have been created specifically for off-road cycling. The main components of a mountain bike are durability, suspension, and versatility. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes, but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain. These typically include a front or full suspension, large knobby tires, more durable wheels, more powerful brakes, lower gear ratios for climbing steep grades, and higher gear ratios for going down steep grades. Mountain bikes are typically ridden on mountain trails, singletrack, fire roads, and other unpaved surfaces.</p>
